This is a general blog on the political scene in America today. As a veteran and citizen of this great country I believe that as Americans we all must work together to ensure the Aemrica continues to prosper and serve as a beacon of light in a sometimes dark world. Too many people are fostering divisions in our society for their own gain and sowing seeds of discontent that threaten American hegemony. As Americans we must respect all views and continue to work towards a more secure and porperous future.
